# steam-keen-config
Improved DOSBox config for Commander Keen Complete Pack on Steam

This is intended to be used with [DOSBox-X](http://dosbox-x.com/) due to its improved PC speaker emulation.

Release .zips are provided in the `Releases` tab, complete with the shareware Keen Dreams and the Keen 6 demo. If you have the full versions of either of these, they can be dropped into their respective folders.

The `dosbox.conf` file needs to be saved with the code page 437 encoding in order to render the episode selection menu properly.
